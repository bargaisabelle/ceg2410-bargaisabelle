## Setup AD DC

- Configuring a Windows Server to be a Domain Controller
  - Install Active Directory Domain Services
  - Select 'Add Roles and Features' in the configuration menu, which will open the Wizard
  - Select 'Next' until you reach Server Roles
  - Ensure 'Active Directory Domain Services' is selected
  - Then you may proceed to Install (will most likely restart upon installation)
 
  - In the Active Directory Services Configuration Wizard, where you can promote the server into a Domain Controller
  - Select 'Add a new forest' and enter a root domain name
  - The other options are unneccessary and you may click 'Install'
  - Congrats! You made a AD DC.
