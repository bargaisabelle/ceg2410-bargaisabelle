Hard drive failure emminent:

Your boss brings you his system because it makes "a clicky noise" now.
According to a fortune teller, you have 24 hours before the disk is dead.
Boss has a meeting in 24 hours and needs a system operational and all data on the system.

What would you do?

Responses should include:
- Additional details you would like
  - Is the system still performing as it should/how it normally does? 
  - Have you recently downloaded any programs or softwares?
  - Have you recently cleaned your fans or moved your computer? if yes, we should open the pc and make sure no
    wires are hitting the fan or no other parts are out of place. Let's clean the machine's fans if not.
  - We can then check for any where the noise is coming from if it is obvious and easy 
    to determine.
    
  - How old is the hard drive/has it been replaced?
  
- Getting data from the dying disk

    Begin by backing up the data by booting into windows
    you can clone your old drive into an external drive and then connect the new drive, 
    and transfre the data from the external drive to the new one.
  - Install a software that can remove the files, recover the hard drives, and save them.



 
- Moving data to a new system
  - Determine the type of drive and get a replacement. You have to configure and initialize a 
    disk. To do this, it needs a partition table, partitions, and then set up the filesystem.
