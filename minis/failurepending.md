Hard drive failure emminent:

Your boss brings you his system because it makes "a clicky noise" now.
According to a fortune teller, you have 24 hours before the disk is dead.
Boss has a meeting in 24 hours and needs a system operational and all data on the system.

What would you do?

Responses should include:
- Additional details you would like
  - Is the system still performing as it should/how it normally does? 
  - Have you recently downloaded any programs or softwares?
  
- Getting data from the dying disk
  - Install a software that can remove the files, recover the hard drives, and save them.
 
- Moving data to a new system
